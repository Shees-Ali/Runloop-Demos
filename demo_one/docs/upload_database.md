# Steps to Upload Database to Devbox on Runloop.ai

Follow these steps to upload a SQLite database to a Devbox on Runloop.ai.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. Ensure you have the `runloop_client` library installed.
2. Set up logging to capture information and errors.
3. Define the environment variable `DATABASE_FILE` to store the path to your SQLite database file.

## Step 2: Define the Database Upload Function

Create a function `upload_database_to_devbox` to handle the database upload:

```python
def upload_database_to_devbox(devbox_id):
    """Upload the SQLite database to the Devbox."""
    try:
        with open(DATABASE_FILE, "rb") as db_file:
            runloop_client.devboxes.upload_file(
                devbox_id,
                path="/home/user/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite",
                file=db_file
            )
        logger.info(f"Database {DATABASE_FILE} uploaded successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to upload database: {e}")
        raise
```

## Step 3: Execute the Function

1. Call the `upload_database_to_devbox` function in your main script or application, passing the Devbox ID as an argument.
2. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the database upload process.

## Step 4: Verify the Database Upload

1. Check the logs to ensure the database was uploaded successfully.
2. Verify that the database file exists on the Devbox at the specified path.

By following these steps, you will be able to upload a SQLite database to a Devbox on Runloop.ai for further use in your development environment.
